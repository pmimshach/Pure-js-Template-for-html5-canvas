This is a simple template for a html5 canvas animation

The project is made by Gianluca Guarini and you can feedback on github

The core of this application is main.js. In this file you can find every basical objects you need to start a great canvas animation.

As you know to draw on a canvas you need to create a javascript loop and update the coordinates of every object on the stage. The most important thing to know is that you can loop in three ways:

    Using the new window.requestAnimationFrame API
    Using setInterval()
    Using setTimeout() at the end of the loop function calling itself againg and again

Here you can find some examples of this ways to loop and as you should know you can choose the best way to animate your application controlling CPU performance
